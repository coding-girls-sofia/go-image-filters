# Image Filters With Kernels

This repo houses the code from the [Golang 101
workshop](https://www.coding-girls.com/golang-101-intro-golang-part-1) organised
by [Coding Girls Sofia](https://www.coding-girls.com/location/sofia) and Uber
Tech Sofia.

## What it does

This is a simple application that applies an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)">image kernel</a> to a given image file.

It demonstrates how to several several basic tasks using Go:
 * fundamental language syntax for variable, function and type definitions, as
   well as basic control flow structures
 * reading/writing files
 * basic image decoding/encoding using the builtin `image` package
 * abstractions we can achieve through types and methods
 * basics of writing tests in go
